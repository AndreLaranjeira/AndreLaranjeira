# André Filipe Caldas Laranjeira

I'm a programmer from Brasília, Brazil. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Brasília and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Georgia.

I enjoy programming, designing software, playing videogames and reading books. I believe that good code needs to be refactored, tested and documented. No exceptions! I specifically like to listen to movie and videogame soundtracks or Lo-fi while programming \(Hans Zimmer, particularly, is a favorite composer of mine\). The hours fly by much faster with good music and a couple of coding problems to be solved.

## Current occupations

* Looking for a job under the OPT program. If you are interested in hiring me, you can download my [Resume](./doc/Resume.pdf).
