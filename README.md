# André Filipe Caldas Laranjeira

I'm a programmer from Brasília, Brazil. I enjoy programming, architecturing software, playing videogames and reading. I believe that good code needs to be commented, tested and refactored. No exceptions!

⚡ Fun fact: I like to listen to Hans Zimmer's movie soundtracks and some videogame original soundtracks (Portal 2, Shatter, etc...) while programming. The hours fly by much faster with a good soundtrack playlist and a couple of coding problems to be solved.

## Current occupations

* Computer engineering student at the Universidade de Brasília (UnB);
* Oracle Apex intern developer at the Tribunal de Contas da União (TCU).
