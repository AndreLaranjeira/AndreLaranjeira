# André Filipe Caldas Laranjeira

I'm a programmer from Brasília, Brazil who majored in Computer Engineering. I enjoy programming, architecting software, playing videogames and reading. I believe that good code needs to be commented, tested and refactored. No exceptions!

I specifically like to listen to Hans Zimmer's movie soundtracks and some videogame original soundtracks (Portal 2, Shatter, etc...) while programming. The hours fly by much faster with a good soundtrack playlist and a couple of coding problems to be solved.
