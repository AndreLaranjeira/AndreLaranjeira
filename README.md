### Hello, world! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is André Filipe Caldas Laranjeira and I'm a programmer from Brasília, Brazil. I love programming and I believe that good code needs to be commented, tested and refactored. No exceptions!

#### Current occupations

1. Computer engineering student at the Universidade de Brasília (UnB).
2. Oracle Apex intern developer at the Tribunal de Contas da União (TCU).
3. CFO of the junior enterprise [Struct - Empresa Júnior de Engenharia de Computação](https://www.linkedin.com/company/struct-ej/)

#### About me

- :computer: I’m currently working on Oracle Apex websites and a NodeJS + React website.
- :bookmark_tabs: I’m currently learning how to program in Rust.
- :books: I'm currently reading Clean code by Robert C. Martin.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer's soundtracks because they make for excellent background music while programming.
