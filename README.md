### Hello, world! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is AndrÃ© Filipe Caldas Laranjeira and I'm a programmer from BrasÃ­lia, Brazil. I love programming and I believe that good code needs to be commented, tested and refactored. No exceptions!

#### Current occupations

1. Computer engineering student at the Universidade de BrasÃ­lia (UnB).
2. Oracle Apex intern developer at the Tribunal de Contas da UniÃ£o (TCU).
3. CFO of the junior enterprise [Struct - Empresa JÃºnior de Engenharia de ComputaÃ§Ã£o](https://www.linkedin.com/company/struct-ej/)

#### About me

- :computer: Iâ€™m currently working on Oracle Apex websites and a NodeJS + React website.
