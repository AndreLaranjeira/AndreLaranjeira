### Hello, world! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is André Filipe Caldas Laranjeira and I'm a programmer from Brasília, Brazil. I love programming and I believe that good code needs to be commented, tested and refactored. No exceptions!

#### Current occupations

1. Computer engineering student at the Universidade de Brasília (UnB);
2. Oracle Apex intern developer at the Tribunal de Contas da União (TCU).

#### About me

- :computer: I’m currently working on Oracle Apex websites and a NodeJS + React website.
- :bookmark_tabs: I’m currently learning how to program in Rust.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to programming!
- 📫 How to reach me: andrecaldaslaranjeira@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer's soundtracks because they make for excellent background music while programming.
