# André Filipe Caldas Laranjeira

I'm a programmer from Brasília, Brazil with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Brasília. I enjoy programming, designing software, playing videogames and reading books. I believe that good code needs to be commented, tested and refactored. No exceptions!

I specifically like to listen to soundtracks from movies, videogames or TV series while programming \(Hans Zimmer is a particular favorite composer of mine\). The hours fly by much faster with a good soundtrack playlist and a couple of coding problems to be solved.

## Current occupations

* Student at the University of Georgia in the M.S. in Computer Science Thesis option program;
* Reading \(sporadically\) _The Rust Programming Language - 2nd edition_ to learn about Rust;
